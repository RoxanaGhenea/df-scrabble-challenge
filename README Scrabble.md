# Scrabble Challenge - References

> While attempting to solve the Scrabble challenge, I encountered the concept of streams, which I discovered to be widely used in the industry. 
> In order to expand my knowledge, I decided to explore and practice streams by applying them to the Scrabble Challenge.
